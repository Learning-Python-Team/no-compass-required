Beginner python project exploring the use of the Google Maps API to collect business contact information

You will need an API Key:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/get-api-key

Current Project Phase
Phase 1:
* Setup the API pulls for GMaps
* Figure out the output mechanisms and try creating meaningful groups in the data
* Setup load jobs into spreadsheet formats.

Future Project Phases
Phase 2:
* Work on filtering the API pulls basis location, business type, etc.
* Further refinement of the data captured in the spreadsheets (spaces/blank line removals, etc.)

Phase 3:
* Build aesthetics like output folder selection, results limiting options, etc.
* Explore GUI interface option
